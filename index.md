### Professinal assessment (add below and delte th is text)

My journey with Southern New Hampshire University has helped to established a foundation and skill set that can be used to market toward potential employers. Completion of coursework throughout the program ranging from using multiple languages (Java, Python, C##) to development methodologies, machine learning, mobile development, UI/UX design, full-stack development and reverse engineering, will support a career in the ever evolving computer science field. This showcases my values and skills to an organization, allowing me to enhance and transform existing applications in the organization or start-up, into a production ready assets. 

One example of growth and knowledge in full-stack development, is from the Austin Animal Shelter Single-Page Application (SPA). Initially written in Python using the Dash framework, the application displayed recuse data types in a grid, breed distribution chart and an interactive map to pin animal locations. For my capstone, I translated the original project into Java, using Vaadin for user interface, MongoDB for database management and Spring boot for backend. I further enhanced the original artifact with an advanced algorithm to improve filtering and data retrieval. The final enhancement added API integration to allow for modularity and a login page to provided additional security. Overall, this demonstrated my ability to plan and adapt to new frameworks or tools. I referenced the user requirements as before to ensure all components worked as intended, without adding unnecessary elements or visuals to the application. Additionally, it showcase my problem solving skills and the correlation from classroom learning to real-world scenarios, such as working with large set of animal data at any other animal shelter or organization.

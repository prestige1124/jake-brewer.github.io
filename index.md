### Professinal assessment 

My journey with Southern New Hampshire University has helped to established a foundation and skill set that can be used to market toward potential employers. Completion of coursework throughout the program ranging from using multiple languages (Java, Python, C##) to development methodologies, machine learning, mobile development, UI/UX design, full-stack development and reverse engineering, will support a career in the ever evolving computer science field. This showcases my values and skills to an organization, allowing me to enhance and transform existing applications in the organization or start-up, into a production ready assets. 

One example of growth and knowledge in full-stack development, is from the Austin Animal Shelter Single-Page Application (SPA). Initially written in Python using the Dash framework, the application displayed recuse data types in a grid, breed distribution chart and an interactive map to pin animal locations. For my capstone, I translated the original project into Java, using Vaadin for user interface, MongoDB for database management and Spring boot for backend. I further enhanced the original artifact with an advanced algorithm to improve filtering and data retrieval. The final enhancement added API integration to allow for modularity and a login page to provided additional security. Overall, this demonstrated my ability to plan and adapt to new frameworks or tools. I referenced the user requirements as before to ensure all components worked as intended, without adding unnecessary elements or visuals to the application. Additionally, it showcase my problem solving skills and the correlation from classroom learning to real-world scenarios, such as working with large set of animal data at any other animal shelter or organization.

  ‚Ä¢ Collaborating in a Team Environment: Even though my studies remained entirely online, away from a traditional classrooms setting, I was still able to collaborate and gain new insights by working with others through design reviews, code reviews, case study discussions and GitHub repertoires. Through GitHub, I was able to set up repertoires with version controls, branches and maintain clear code documentation with detailed ReadME files. The experience has provided a foundation on the usage of GitHub, allowing me to perform advanced task such as explore pull request and collaboration with others outside of an education environment. 
  
  ‚Ä¢ Communicating with Stakeholders: During my numerous design and development life-cycles, I have been able to articulate and present applications to both technical and non-technical audiences; ensuring clarity and explanations in the project. While not directly working in assigned groups, I have demonstrated the ability to convert stakeholder and client requirements, into business ready applications that encompass the stakeholders and clients vision. 
  
  ‚Ä¢ Data Structures and Algorithms: Throughout my course work I implemented various foundational data structures and algorithms to acquire a certain value or result. Clean data structures and precise algorithms allows for the application to handle large datasets efficiently and improve overall webpage or mobile page responsiveness. Additionally, clean and accurate data supports data structures to ensure applications, such as Keras for machine learning, can effectively utilize the available data. Corrupted, invalid and missing data types can further hinder the algorithms ability to generate a sufficient result or value. 
  
  ‚Ä¢ Software Engineering and Database: To adhere to software engineering best practices, I created a modulator architectures with clean code structure, design principles and version controls through GitHub. My experience expands to both relational and NoSQL databases, primarily with MongoDB. MongoDB was chosen as my database tool for its easy management and query flexibility. Additionally, software engineering test strategies and tools were utilized to verify input validation (JUnit testing) and verification when authenticating a user (Postman) during the design and development process.
  
  ‚Ä¢ Security: Additionally, I incorporated best security practices and principles through various development processes, including secure authentication with tokens, input validation, reverse engineering for vulnerabilities, and secure full-stack API usage. This includes mobile security with secure login using credentials stored on the local device. The overreaching goal of security in the market place, is to ensure that both the organizations and customers data is protected and personal information kept private.

My portfolio contains artifacts the collectively demonstrate a full range of abilities in the computer science field; more specifically full-stack engineering, UI/UX design and security practices. The original artifact, developed using Python with the Dash framework, showcases my ability to refactor and enhance existing software, translate from an existing language and implement full-stack methods that fully integrate an interactive frontend, database management, backend logic and API calls. The final artifact is the culmination of theses enhancments, providing Austin Animal Shelter with a fully functional webpage with user authentication and ease of access for all users; technical and non technical. Combined, these artifacts and their iterations presents a clear picture of my growth from a student, to a professional capable of delivering business ready solutions that are both productive and secure.

The original artifact is a Python single-page application using the Dash framework for prototyping; written in Jupyter notebooks. To enhance the artifact and provide users with efficiency and productivity; I have identified three areas to expand. Software design and engineering,¬† algorithms and data structure¬† databases. 
First step was to translate from Python to Java. This included researching comparable components such as the pie-chart, grid and interactive map. Vaadin (frontend) was chosen for its simplicity and ability to be fully written in Java; paired with MongoDB as the database structure and Spring Boot for backend services. The second enchantment expanded upon and added an additional algorithm function. This includes creating new interface components to allow the user to select two parameters, with a wider range of data to choose from. The original artifact only allowed the user to select specific rescue types based on dog breeds; where as the enchantment allows the user to select any animal within a selected age range. The third enchantment refactored the existing code to implement API calls and created modularity within the application. Additionally, I created a login page to direct user to authenticate before accessing data, and making unauthorized changes to the large dataset. This security practice follows the Zero Trust model; first authenticate, then trust. The combination of enhancements completes the full-stack development from a simple Python SPA to a complex, but modular application. More importantly, this can be utilized to expand to other devices such as Android phones or tablets (either in Java or Kotlin).
